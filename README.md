R codes to implement the simulation study in "A generalized phase I/II dose optimization trial design with multi-categorical and multi-graded outcomes"

# Description
We propose a phase I/II design that simultaneously considers multi-categorical toxicity and efficacy with multi-graded outcomes, measured as quasi-continuous probability based on prespecified weight matrices of clinical significance. Following keyboard design, our approach aims to screen out overly toxic doses by the toxicity probability intervals and adaptively makes dose escalation or de-escalation decisions by comparing the posterior distributions of dose desirability (utility) among the adjacent levels of the current dose. It helps to more accurately identify the optimal biological dose (OBD) in a non-monotonically increasing dose-efficacy relationship.
